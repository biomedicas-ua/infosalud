00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.720
Hello everyone, we are Cristina and Elena, and today&nbsp;
we will briefly talk about bronchitis:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.200
a common respiratory disease&nbsp;
that affects the bronchi.
&nbsp;

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.600
Well, this is the table of contents which&nbsp;
we will present to you one by one below.
&nbsp;

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.600
First, the introduction: What is bronchitis?&nbsp;
Bronchitis is the inflammation of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.680
bronchial tubes, the airways that carry&nbsp;
oxygen to your lungs. Most cases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.640
of acute bronchitis improve within a few days, but&nbsp;
the cough can last several weeks after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.840
the infection has cleared up. Often, the&nbsp;
same viruses that cause colds and flu&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.880
can cause acute bronchitis. These viruses&nbsp;
spread through the air when someone coughs or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.440
through physical contact, for example,&nbsp;
when someone hasn’t washed their hands.
&nbsp;

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.600
Likewise, bacteria can cause acute bronchitis,&nbsp;
but not as often as viruses.
&nbsp;

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.480
In the image on the right, we can&nbsp;
see a comparison of bronchitis with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.560
normal bronchi. In bronchitis,&nbsp;
we can see that the bronchus is much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.360
more inflamed and clogged with mucus.
Symptoms. Bronchitis presents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.440
with symptoms like a persistent cough,&nbsp;
usually accompanied by phlegm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.280
shortness of breath, and, in some cases,&nbsp;
fever and fatigue. Sometimes, the chest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.560
may feel tight or under slight pressure.&nbsp;
These symptoms usually last one to two weeks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.680
but the cough can last longer.
If these symptoms appear, especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.520
shortness of breath and fever,&nbsp;
it’s advisable to see a doctor for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.200
a full diagnosis and to consider&nbsp;
treatment options.
&nbsp;

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.080
As for the causes, bronchitis can be&nbsp;
caused by infections or environmental factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.600
It’s usually caused by viral infections,&nbsp;
such as those that cause colds and flu, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.920
it can also be due to bacteria or irritants&nbsp;
like cigarette smoke, pollution, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.840
chemicals. Cold or sudden temperature&nbsp;
changes can increase the risk.
&nbsp;

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.080
Finally, regarding treatment. Usually,&nbsp;
only the symptoms are treated while the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.160
immune system does its job and clears the&nbsp;
virus. Fever is usually treated with antipyretics,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.080
such as acetaminophen, and cough medications.&nbsp;
Also, treatment depends on whether bronchitis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.600
is acute or chronic. For acute bronchitis, doctors&nbsp;
usually recommend rest, staying hydrated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.400
and, if necessary, medications to relieve&nbsp;
the cough. In cases of chronic bronchitis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.640
it’s important to avoid irritants&nbsp;
like tobacco, and longer-term&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.080
medical treatment may be needed. Consulting&nbsp;
a healthcare professional is always essential.
&nbsp;

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.080
Some relevant data that the creators&nbsp;
of this presentation found interesting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.200
for example, is that bronchitis affects&nbsp;
5% of the adult population and occurs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.840
more frequently in winter. In Spain, there&nbsp;
are over 200,000 cases of bronchitis annually.
&nbsp;

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.880
To conclude, we wanted to emphasize that,&nbsp;
if you have persistent symptoms, consult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:16.520
a doctor. Taking care of our lungs is vital&nbsp;
for our quality of life. Thank you very much.
